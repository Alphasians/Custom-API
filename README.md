# NodeJS + AstraDB API

1. Clone the Repo first.
```
git clone https://github.com/Alphasians/Custom-API.git
```

2. Create a unique Namespace in your AstraDB.
3. Get the credentials such as DB_ID, DB_Region and Application_Token. Learn more from [here](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/docs/getting-started/gs-grant-user-access.html). 
Once you get these credentials store them in .env.
4. According to the needs you make changes in the ``controllers`` & ``routes`` folder. 

### Kudos you have finally made your own Custom APIðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³. 
#### Use Postman for the testing purposes, afterwards it can be hosted on Heroku for global usage.
